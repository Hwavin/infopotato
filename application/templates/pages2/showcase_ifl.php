<p>
Since 1995 the Institute for Learning (IFL) has worked to improve the education and achievement of all students, especially those who are underserved.
</p>

<p>
The IFL helps build the foundation for student learning among educators, schools, and districts by working with them in three key areas. The first is knowledge—about content, pedagogy and leadership. The second is community—vibrant learning communities that support, inspire, and teach educators. The third is tools—tools that teach and assist adults in the educational community to do better jobs. The IFL's work is built around high quality teaching, learning and curriculum in the core content areas of English language arts, mathematics, science, and history / social studies. The IFL's tools include leadership tools and a set of research-based units K-12 in the four core content areas. The units are ready for classroom implementation; but, even more importantly, serve as templates for revision of local curriculum.
</p>

<p>
Located at the Learning Research and Development Center of the University of Pittsburgh, the IFL works closely with both researchers and educators to translate research findings into practical actions that teachers, administrators, schools, and districts can implement to help close the learning gap and promote high student achievement. The IFL functions as a bridge between the domains of research and practice, bringing educators the best of current knowledge, research, tools, and models related to instruction and district design.
