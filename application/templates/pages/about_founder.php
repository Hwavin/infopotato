Now, for something behind the scenes. My chinese name is Zhou Yuan and my english name is Joe. I work as an enthusiastic web designer &amp; developer that aims to create vibrant and detailed designs while keeping the aesthetics, web standards, security, usability, and accessibility aspects in mind. Creating this PHP MVC Framework is just my humble contribution back to the community.

<h2>How did I get into web development?</h2>
<p> 
Back to my junior year at University of Sciecne and Technology Beijing, I began to deal with web design and development. My first project was an online discussion forum for mathetics fans proposed by my sister's boyfriend. During that period I spent a lot of time to learn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossday_Discuz!_Board" class="external_link" title="External link">Discuz!</a> (A great open source PHP Forum in China). To get a comprehensive understanding of PHP I took the professional training program and examination created by Zend PHPChina, and I gained the Zend PHPChian Certification. After that I wrote several chinese version websites for my university and friends.

<p> 
In 2007, I worked as a webmail developer at BBDTEK Technology Co., Ltd. with two seasoned programmers from Founder Technology Group. My major responsibilities were analyzing two open-source browser-based multilingual IMAP client written in PHP and AJAX (<a href="http://squirrelmail.org/" class="external_link">SquirrelMail</a> &amp; <a href="http://roundcube.net/" class="external_link">RoundCube</a>). I also did configuration and modification of the Postfix SMTP server in Linux (CentOS and Federa). Through webmail development, I had largely increased my knowledge and skills in advanced object-oriented programming, Mail Transfer Protocol, methods of authentication, and data encryption.
</p> 

<p> 
To pursue the Master degree, I left BBDTEK and came to USA in 2008. At the beginning of my new chapter in Pittsburgh, I found a part-time job in Petersen Events Center where I was the web designer and I created four websites with PHP+XHTML+JS+XML+CSS+MySQL/SQLServer2005 for Intramurals and Recreation program. I had a wonderful experience there, and the websites I designed helped the faculty and staff a lot.

Since the end of February 2009 I've been working as a web system programmer at <a href="http://www.instituteforlearning.org" class="external_link">Institute for Learning (IFL)</a> in Learning Resaerch &amp; Development Center. I redesigned the IFL portal website and created Video Request System and Time Tracker System based on users' requirements and feedbacks for the Institute. At the same time, I'm responsible for redesign and maintainence of other member district websites and Online Self-Study Tools for internal and external use, as well as trouble shooting for Redhat Linux server, Apache web server, LDAP server, samba server and Windows fileserver with the guys in Computing Services. Here I have opportunities to use more advanced LAMP techniques to build a bridge between the domains of research and practice.

<h2>What do I want to do in the future?</h2>
<p>
I hope to do something that I can continually develop my skills, whatever the industry. I never want to be stuck in a dead-end job with no prospects. I plan to build a professional IT team and create something exciting with core competence. I want to be constantly innovating and creating new things... <strong>I believe in my work. That's the dreams and I insist on them</strong>!
