<h1>Oh, Snap! <span class="red_tx">Error 404</span></h1>

<p> 
Uh oh, looks like you've stumbled on a page that can't be found! This is probably due to one of the following reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone flat out stole it. Shame on them.</li>
<li>You typed the URL incorrectly. It's ok. It happens.</li>
<li>Your computer is holding a grudge against you. Life's too short, man.</li>
<li>You clicked on an outdated link. Sorry about that.</li>
</ul>
