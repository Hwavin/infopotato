</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>Truly Loose Coupling</strong>

</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>

InfoPotato is equipped with many security measures to help prevent your Web applications from attacks such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection" class="external_link">SQL injection</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" class="external_link">cross-site scripting (XSS)</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSRF" class="external_link">cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</a>.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No URI Routing</strong> 
InfoPotato implements a simple Regular Expression based routes system for mapping URLs to controllers/actions. With URI routes, you get clean URL for your website which is good for SEO purpose.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>Multiple Database (SQL &amp; NoSQL) Adapters</strong>

</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>Truly Lightweight &amp; Fast</strong> 
InfoPotato's core system requires only a few very small components. Additional libraries/scripts are loaded dynamically upon request. It uses the lazy loading and avoids slow PHP functions &amp; methods.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>Small learning curve &amp; Detailed documentation</strong> 
Every single method or property is clearly documented. A book and comprehensive tutorials are also available for you to systematically learn InfoPotato.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No Object Relational Mapping (ORM)</strong> 
Since RDBMS is not necessary, InfoPotato doesn't implement ORM. When working with SQL CRUD, raw SQL queries is an efficient method of data access using the simple database adapters. 
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No ACL/RBAC system</strong> 
InfoPotato encourages developers to use thirty-party or their own Access Control mechanism for complex multi-user applications.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No Tamplating system</strong> 
Why brother to learn a new templating language? Just use PHP's alternative syntax in the View. Template engines simply can not match the performance of native PHP.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No I18N/L10N Support</strong> 
I18N/L10N Support will break the Loose Coupling that InfoPotato designed for. So InfoPotato encourages the developer to design their own solution.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
<strong>No Integrated Javascript Library</strong> 
Yes, InfoPotato doesn't integrate with any popular Javascript libraries. Because not every project requires Javascript. But you can always use Javascript with InfoPotato very easily.
</p>
</div> 

<div>
<p>
<strong>No Automatic code generation</strong> 
The auto generated frontend/backend design which are usually hard to modify and maintain later on. InfoPotato doesn't want to cause developers more trouble and make them lazy to think.
</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
<strong>No use of command line</strong> 
InfoPotato doesn't require  the use of command line. Why bother?
