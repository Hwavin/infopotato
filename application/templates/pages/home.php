InfoPotato is a very lightweight, well-designed & well-documented PHP5 framework loosely built around HTTP in a RESTful approach. It incorporated many good ideas and useful components from other well-known web frameworks and toolkits. Working with InfoPotato in a structured and rapid manner enables web developers to create efficient, extensible, and maintainable web applications.
