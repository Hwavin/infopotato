Congratulations! By learning about InfoPotato, you're well on your way towards being a more productive, well-rounded and popular web developer (actually, you're on your own for the last part). Any software application requires some effort to learn. A framework will be "easy to use" if it has clear and concise documentation and its source code has extensive and meaningful comments. We've done our best to minimize the learning curve while making the process as enjoyable as possible. This documentation assumes that you have a general understanding of PHP and a basic understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP). Different functionality within the framework makes use of different technologies – such as SQL, JavaScript, CSS, and XML – and this documentation does not attempt to explain those technologies, only how they are used in context. This documentation is a work in progress. There are planned areas I haven't written yet. Without much babble, start your journey and see how you can use InfoPotato.
