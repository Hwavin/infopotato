<p begin="00:00:08.000" end="00:00:17.700">The English learners that are attending our schools, and are attending our schools in increasing numbers, are a huge untapped resource.</p>
<p begin="00:00:18.300" end="00:00:26.600">These are children and young people with goals, dreams, aspirations.</p>
<p begin="00:00:27.086" end="00:00:32.500">They have enriched, and they can continue to enrich the social fabric of the society.</p>
<p begin="00:00:33.700" end="00:00:42.200">It is absolutely imperative that we work very hard to take full advantage of this potential.</p>
<p begin="00:00:43.100" end="00:00:51.000">I have suggested these three guiding principles of primary language instruction, generic effective instruction, and adjustments that are needed,</p>
<p begin="00:00:51.100" end="00:00:58.800">as the basic framework for thinking about how to enhance the educational opportunities of these students,</p>
<p begin="00:00:58.900" end="00:01:01.100">but I see that really as only a starting point.</p>
<p begin="00:01:01.200" end="00:01:10.200">We have much farther to go if we're to really fully understand how to tap the potential of these students.</p>
<p begin="00:01:10.300" end="00:01:17.100">I have every confidence that we'll do it, but it is a challenge -- it is a real challenge.</p>
<p begin="00:01:17.300" end="00:01:21.600">Teachers are on the front lines, being challenged on a daily basis,</p>
<p begin="00:01:21.800" end="00:01:29.200">many of them working extraordinarily hard to do the best they can for their students, which is why they're in the classroom.</p>
<p begin="00:01:29.300" end="00:01:37.000">We need to provide the infrastructure, the support, the time, the opportunity to plan and work with other teachers,</p>
<p begin="00:01:37.300" end="00:01:43.322">to receive the kind of professional development and opportunities for reflective practice --</p>
<p begin="00:01:43.422" end="00:01:51.622">because without that, no amount of research is really going to solve this problem.</p>
<p begin="00:01:51.900" end="00:01:55.700">I think we can build on the research -- we have to build on the research.</p>
<p begin="00:01:56.000" end="00:02:02.500">We also have to make it happen out in the schools: that's really the challenge that we all face.</p>
